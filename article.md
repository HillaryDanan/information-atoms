# Information Atoms: A Multimodal AI Sketch

> A research sketch exploring hexagonal grids, trust dynamics, and unified representations. Not a breakthrough - just ideas worth discussing.

## Current multimodal AI faces interesting constraints

The latest multimodal models - GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.5 - represent remarkable engineering achievements. GPT-4o processes text, images, audio, and video within a single neural network with response times as low as 232ms (averaging 320ms). Gemini 2.0 Flash handles 1 million token contexts, while Gemini 2.0 Pro extends this to 2 million tokens. Yet these systems still operate within the paradigm of tokenization, which creates interesting constraints worth exploring.

Current performance on benchmarks like MMMU (Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding) shows models achieving 69.1% accuracy while human experts score 76.2â€“88.6%. When evaluation frameworks eliminate shortcuts (MMMU-Pro), performance drops by 16.8â€“26.9%. These gaps suggest architectural constraints that might benefit from alternative approaches.

## The tokenization paradigm: Understanding current approaches

Research from 2023â€“2025 highlights several characteristics of current tokenization:

**Multilingual processing differences:** Some languages require up to 10x more tokens than English for equivalent meaning. The Thai word for "hello" (à¸ªà¸§à¸±à¸ªà¸”à¸µ) needs 6 tokens versus 1 for English. Languages like Armenian and Burmese can require 9â€“10 times more tokens than English for equivalent text. This creates computational asymmetries across languages.

**Visual tokenization patterns:** Current vision transformers typically use 16x16 pixel patches. For a 1024x1024 image, this results in 4,096 patches (64x64 grid). Each patch is processed as a separate unit before attention mechanisms attempt to reconstruct relationships. This fragmentation affects how models process spatial relationships.

**Cross-modal compression:** When visual features are compressed into tokens for language model consumption, a 1024x1024 image containing millions of bits gets compressed into as few as 256 tokens in cutting-edge 2025 systems like Layton - a 16x improvement over traditional methods. The Byte Latent Transformer research shows that even text tokenization creates information bottlenecks.

## Current approaches and their trade-offs

Today's multimodal models use sophisticated fusion strategies that go beyond simple concatenation:

- **Unified architectures:** Models like GPT-4o process all modalities through a single neural network with complex attention mechanisms
- **Progressive fusion:** QFormer structures and cross-attention mechanisms enable gradual integration of modalities
- **Dynamic adaptation:** Modern systems adjust fusion strategies based on the specific modalities and content being processed

Recent innovations like Meta's Byte Latent Transformer (December 2024) achieve interesting results by eliminating fixed tokenization, while SeTok (Semantic-Equivalent Vision Tokenizer, June 2024) explores dynamic visual tokenizers that cluster features semantically.

## A theoretical exploration: Information atoms

What if we explored multimodal representation differently? This framework presents "information atoms" - a theoretical approach that reimagines how modalities might be unified. This is not a proven method but rather a creative exploration for discussion.

### The concept

Instead of tokenizing each modality separately, information atoms would:

- Maintain cross-modal relationships from the start
- Use spatial arrangements inspired by hexagonal packing (proven optimal in 2D)
- Incorporate trust dynamics from game theory for adaptive fusion
- Process information at multiple hierarchical levels

### Why hexagonal arrangements?

Hexagonal packing is mathematically proven optimal for 2D arrangements:

- **Packing efficiency:** Ï€/(2âˆš3) â‰ˆ 0.9069 for hexagonal vs Ï€/4 â‰ˆ 0.7854 for square
- **Uniform 6-neighbor connectivity**
- **Better rotational symmetry** (6-fold vs 4-fold)
- **More isotropic frequency response**

While rarely used in current AI systems, hexagonal grids have shown benefits in specific applications like aerial scene classification and 3D shape recognition. Their application to general multimodal AI remains unexplored.

### Trust-based fusion: A game theory perspective

Drawing from established research in game-theoretic multiagent reinforcement learning, what if modalities built "trust" through successful cooperation? This approach would:

- Increase weights when modalities provide consistent information
- Decrease weights during conflicts
- Adapt dynamically to changing reliability

Game theory approaches have proven successful in improving LLM performance through consensus games and Nash equilibrium optimization. Applying these principles to multimodal fusion represents a natural extension, though practical implementation faces challenges.

## Implementation explorations

The accompanying code framework demonstrates these concepts through:

1. **Hexagonal spatial organization** for unified representations
2. **Cross-modal bonds** explicitly maintaining relationships
3. **Trust networks** for dynamic fusion
4. **Hierarchical processing** at computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels

These implementations are exploratory prototypes, not optimized systems. They serve to make abstract concepts concrete for discussion.

## Novel aspects and open questions

This exploration introduces several concepts not found in current literature:

**Information atoms:** No existing research uses this specific combination of:
- Hexagonal spatial arrangement for multimodal data
- Explicit cross-modal bonds
- Trust-based adaptive fusion
- Unified representation from the start

**Open questions:**
- Can hexagonal arrangements provide practical benefits despite implementation complexity?
- How would trust dynamics scale to many modalities?
- What are the computational trade-offs of maintaining cross-modal bonds?
- Could this approach complement rather than replace tokenization?

## Relationship to current research

This work builds on established concepts while proposing novel combinations:

**Established foundations:**
- Hexagonal packing optimality (Lagrange 1773, Fejes TÃ³th 1940â€“1942)
- Game theory in neural networks and multiagent RL
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Hierarchical processing levels (Marr)

**Novel integrations:**
- Applying hexagonal geometry to general multimodal AI
- "Information atom" as unified representation unit
- Spatial arrangement of cross-modal relationships
- Trust networks governing fusion dynamics

## Limitations and future directions

This theoretical exploration has clear limitations:

1. **No empirical validation:** These concepts need testing against benchmarks
2. **Implementation challenges:** Hexagonal processing lacks framework support
3. **Scalability questions:** Computational costs at scale unknown
4. **Comparison gaps:** No direct comparison with BLT, SeTok, or TokenFlow

Future work could:
- Implement small-scale prototypes for testing
- Compare with established tokenization alternatives
- Explore hybrid approaches combining atoms with tokens
- Investigate hardware optimizations for hexagonal operations

## A playground for ideas

This framework is intentionally exploratory - a theoretical playground for discussing alternative approaches to multimodal AI. The "information atom" concept represents one possible direction among many for moving beyond current tokenization paradigms.

The code implementation provides concrete examples of these abstract ideas, making them tangible for critique and iteration. All performance discussions are theoretical - actual benefits or drawbacks remain to be determined through empirical research.

## Invitation for discussion

As we push the boundaries of multimodal AI, exploring alternative architectures becomes increasingly important. This framework offers one speculative approach - not as a solution, but as a conversation starter.

What other novel representations might we explore? How can we better preserve cross-modal relationships? What can we learn from mathematical optimality in other domains?

The journey beyond tokenization will require many creative explorations. This framework contributes one perspective to that ongoing dialogue.
