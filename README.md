# Information Atoms: A Research Playground

> Part of the [Cognitive Architectures for AI](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/cognitive-architectures-ai) research program


A theoretical exploration of alternative approaches to multimodal AI representation. This is a research sketch, not a production framework.

## What This Is

An exploration of some ideas I've been thinking about:
- What if we used hexagonal grids for spatial organization?
- Could game theory principles help with multimodal fusion?
- Is there value in preserving cross-modal relationships earlier?

**This is purely theoretical** - no benchmarks, no empirical validation, just ideas to discuss.

## Quick Demo

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HillaryDanan/information-atoms/blob/main/🚀_Quick_Start.ipynb) - See the basic concepts (5 min)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HillaryDanan/information-atoms/blob/main/📓_Full_Framework.ipynb) - Full exploration (30 min)

## Key Ideas to Explore

1. **Hexagonal arrangements** - Mathematically optimal packing, but is it useful for AI?
2. **Trust-based fusion** - Could modalities adapt weights based on consistency?
3. **Cross-modal bonds** - Worth preserving relationships explicitly?

## Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HillaryDanan/information-atoms.git
cd information-atoms
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.experiments
```

## Context

This builds on:
- Circle packing theorems (math)
- Game theory concepts (multi-agent RL)
- Current multimodal architectures

But combines them in ways that might be interesting to explore.

## Important Notes

- **Not benchmarked** against any baselines
- **Not claiming** to be better than existing methods
- **Not production ready** - this is a research sketch
- **Very early stage** thinking

## Discussion Welcome

If you find any of these ideas interesting or have thoughts on:
- Whether hexagonal processing could ever be practical
- Alternative approaches to multimodal fusion
- Other mathematical structures we could explore

Feel free to open an issue or reach out!
